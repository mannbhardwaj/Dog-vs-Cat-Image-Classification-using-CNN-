A detailed list of requirements for your Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project using CNN 
                                — including libraries, tools, files, and their usage:
 1 . Dataset
  Kaggle – Dogs vs Cats
  Path Used: You downloaded and extracted it to:
  D:/Desktop/jupyter notebook/dogs-vs-cats/

  Contents:
   train/ → 25,000 labeled images (cat.*.jpg, dog.*.jpg)
   test/ → 12,500 images for testing (unlabeled)

2. Deep Learning Framework
 TensorFlow & Keras
Installed via: pip install tensorflow

Used For:
  Building the CNN architecture
  Training and compiling the model
  Saving/loading model using model.save() and load_model()

3. Python Libraries:
                          NumPy
                          Matplotlib
                          OS
                          Pickle
                          PIL (Pillow)
                          Jupyter Notebook

5. File Structure Used:

catvsdog_fixed.h5          Trained model file             
catvsdog_history.pkl     Stores training history: accuracy/loss for plotting 

8. Accuracy & Loss Plot:
       Trained model achieved ~98.8% training accuracy
       Plotted using matplotlib:
                          Train vs Val Accuracy
                          Train vs Val Loss

Final Summary (For Report)
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Using TensorFlow/Keras and the Kaggle dataset,
 the model achieved high accuracy through image preprocessing, model training, andevaluation. It also supports reusability through model and history saving.
