# Dog-vs-Cat-Image-Classification-using-CNN-
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify images as either a cat or a dog. Leveraging image data and TensorFlow/Keras, the model learns to detect visual patterns and features specific to each class.  We use Kaggle’s Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

# Problem Statement
In the digital age, image classification has become an essential application of artificial intelligence. One of the most common classification challenges is differentiating between images of cats and dogs. Although this might seem easy for humans, it poses several challenges for machines due to variations 
This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model that can automatically recognize whether a given image is of a cat or a dog, regardless of such variations. The model is trained using thousands of labeled images and utilizes CNN architecture, which mimics the human visual system to extract patterns and features from images.
