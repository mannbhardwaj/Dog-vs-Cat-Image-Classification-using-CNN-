# Dog-vs-Cat-Image-Classification-using-CNN-
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify images as either a cat or a dog. Leveraging image data and TensorFlow/Keras, the model learns to detect visual patterns and features specific to each class.  We use Kaggleâ€™s Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
